Question: Kevin Kangaroo begins hopping on a number line at 0. He wants to get to 1, but he can hop only $\frac{1}{3}$ of the distance. Each hop tires him out so that he continues to hop $\frac{1}{3}$ of the remaining distance. How far has he hopped after five hops? Express your answer as a common fraction.
Answer:
```python
initial_position = 0
target_position = 1
hop_fraction = 1/3
total_hops = 5

distance_hopped = 0
remaining_distance = target_position - initial_position

for _ in range(total_hops):
    hop_distance = remaining_distance * hop_fraction
    distance_hopped += hop_distance
    remaining_distance -= hop_distance

answer = distance_hopped
```
Execution: Done
Output: answer = 0.8683127572016461

What's the problem with the above code?
1. The answer should be expressed as a common fraction, but the output is a decimal.
2. The calculation seems correct, but the final answer should be simplified to a fraction. 

Here's a better solution:
```python
from fractions import Fraction

initial_position = 0
target_position = 1
hop_fraction = Fraction(1, 3)
total_hops = 5

distance_hopped = Fraction(0, 1)
remaining_distance = Fraction(target_position - initial_position, 1)

for _ in range(total_hops):
    hop_distance = remaining_distance * hop_fraction
    distance_hopped += hop_distance
    remaining_distance -= hop_distance

answer = distance_hopped
print(answer)
```

```python
from sympy import symbols, expand

x = symbols('x')
expression = 3*(x**2 - x**3 + x) + 3*(x + 2*x**3 - 3*x**2 + 3*x**5 + x**3) - 5*(1 + x - 4*x**3 - x**2)
expanded_expression = expand(expression)
coefficient_of_x3 = expanded_expression.coeff(x**3)
answer = coefficient_of_x3
print(answer)
```
Execution: Done
Output: answer = 26

What's the problem with the above code?

1. The coefficient of $x^3$ should be an integer, 26 is reasonable.

2. Let's check the code:

> from sympy import symbols, expand
> x = symbols('x')
> expression = 3*(x**2 - x**3 + x) + 3*(x + 2*x**3 - 3*x**2 + 3*x**5 + x**3) - 5*(1 + x - 4*x**3 - x**2)

This defines the expression correctly.

> expanded_expression = expand(expression)
> coefficient_of_x3 = expanded_expression.coeff(x**3)

This expands the expression and extracts the coefficient of $x^3$, which is correct.

Overall, the code correctly calculates the coefficient of $x^3$ in the given expression. The answer is 26, which is reasonable. 

Here's an alternative solution without using `sympy`:
```python
# We can manually expand the expression and collect the coefficients of x^3:
# 3*(x^2 - x^3 + x) = 3x^2 - 3x^3 + 3x
# 3*(x + 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x^5 + x^3) = 3x + 6x^3 - 9x^2 + 9x^5 + 3x^3
# -5*(1 + x - 4x^3 - x^2) = -5 -5x + 20x^3 + 5x^2
# Now, combine like terms:
# For x^3: -3x^3 + 6x^3 + 3x^3 + 20x^3 = 26x^3
# So the coefficient is 26.
answer = 26
print(answer)
```

Question: The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\pi r^2$. Including the area of its circular base, what is the total surface area of a hemisphere with radius 6 cm? Express your answer in terms of $\pi$.
Answer: 
```python
import math
radius = 6
# Calculate the surface area of a full sphere
sphere_surface_area = 4 * math.pi * radius**2
# Calculate the surface area of a hemisphere (half of the full sphere)
hemisphere_surface_area = sphere_surface_area / 2
# Add the area of the circular base
base_area = math.pi * radius**2
total_surface_area = hemisphere_surface_area + base_area
answer = total_surface_area
print(answer)
```
Execution: Done
Output: answer = 339.29200658769764

What's the problem with the above code?

1. The question asks to express the answer in terms of π, but the code outputs a numerical value. This is not what the question requires.

2. The code correctly calculates the surface area of a hemisphere and adds the area of the circular base, but it should keep the answer in terms of π rather than evaluating it numerically.

Here's a better solution:
```python
radius = 6
# The surface area of a hemisphere (excluding the base) is half of the full sphere's surface area
hemisphere_surface_area = 0.5 * 4 * (radius ** 2)  
base_area = radius ** 2  
# Total surface area is the sum of the hemisphere and the base, in terms of π
total_surface_area_in_terms_of_pi = hemisphere_surface_area + base_area
answer = f"{total_surface_area_in_terms_of_pi}π"
print(answer)
```

Question: There are 12 different-colored crayons in a box. How many ways can Karl select four crayons if the order in which he draws them out does not matter? 
Answer:
```python
import math

# Number of crayons
n = 12
# Number of crayons to select
k = 4

# Calculate the number of combinations
number_of_ways = math.comb(n, k)
answer = number_of_ways
print(answer)
```
Execution: Done
Output: answer = 495

What's the problem with the above code?

1. The code correctly uses the combination formula to calculate the number of ways to choose 4 crayons out of 12 without considering the order. The result is 495, which is accurate.

2. The question is about combinations (order does not matter), and `math.comb(n, k)` is the appropriate function to use here.

Here's an alternative solution without using `math.comb`:
```python
# The number of combinations is given by n! / (k! * (n - k)!)
n = 12
k = 4

# Calculate factorial of n
def factorial(num):
    if num == 0 or num == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return num * factorial(num - 1)

number_of_ways = factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))
answer = number_of_ways
print(answer)
```

Question: Add $101_2 + 11_2 + 1100_2 + 11101_2.$ Express your answer in base $2.$
Answer:
```python
# Convert each binary number to decimal, add them, then convert back to binary
binary_numbers = ['101', '11', '1100', '11101']
decimal_sum = sum(int(num, 2) for num in binary_numbers)
binary_sum = bin(decimal_sum)[2:]  # Remove the '0b' prefix
answer = binary_sum
print(answer)
```
Execution: Done
Output: answer = 110001

What's the problem with the above code?

1. The code correctly converts each binary number to its decimal equivalent, sums them, and then converts the result back to binary. The output is `110001`, which is the correct binary representation of the sum.

2. The question asks for the sum of the binary numbers to be expressed in base 2, and the code achieves this. 

Here's an alternative solution that manually performs binary addition without converting to decimal:
```python
def binary_addition(*bin_numbers):
    max_len = max(len(num) for num in bin_numbers)
    bin_numbers = [num.zfill(max_len) for num in bin_numbers]
    carry = 0
    result = []
    for i in range(max_len - 1, -1, -1):
        total = carry
        for num in bin_numbers:
            total += int(num[i])
        result.append(str(total % 2))
        carry = total // 2
    if carry:
        result.append(str(carry))
    return ''.join(reversed(result))

binary_numbers = ['101', '11', '1100', '11101']
answer = binary_addition(*binary_numbers)
print(answer)
```
