Question: Kevin Kangaroo begins hopping on a number line at 0. He wants to get to 1, but he can hop only $\frac{1}{3}$ of the distance. Each hop tires him out so that he continues to hop $\frac{1}{3}$ of the remaining distance. How far has he hopped after five hops? Express your answer as a common fraction. 
Answer: \frac{211}{243}

Question: A math teacher requires Noelle to do one homework assignment for each of the first five homework points she wants to earn; for each of the next five homework points, she needs to do two homework assignments; and so on, so that to earn the $n^{\text{th}}$ homework point, she has to do $n\div5$ (rounded up) homework assignments. For example, when she has 11 points, it will take $12\div5=2.4\rightarrow3$ homework assignments to earn her $12^{\text{th}}$ point. What is the smallest number of homework assignments necessary to earn a total of 25 homework points? 
Answer: 75
