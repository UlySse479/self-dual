There are two choices to the same math problem. One uses natural language to answer the question, while the other uses Python code to answer it. Either of them can correctly answer the math problem. You need to identify which choice can correctly answer the math problem. Here is one example how to do it,

(A) can correctly answer the math problem. Because (B) missed the fact that computers were added each day from monday to thursday.

Now it's your turn. Here is another math problem and two choices.
Question: A piece of square paper has a perimeter of 32 centimeters. Nicky's dog, Rocky, tore off 1/4 of the paper. What is the area of the remaining paper?

(A)
Answer:
A square has 4 equal sides.
The perimeter of the square paper is 32 centimeters.
So each side of the square is 32 / 4 = 8 centimeters.
The area of the whole square paper is side * side = 8 * 8 = 64 square centimeters.
Rocky tore off 1/4 of the paper.
So The area of the remaining paper is 1/4 * 64 = 16 square centimeters.
So the answer is 16.

(B)
def solution():
    perimeter = 32
    fraction_torn = 1 / 4
    area_total = (perimeter / 4) ** 2
    area_remaining = (1 - fraction_torn) * area_total
    result = area_remaining
    return result

Which of the above two choices can correctly answer the math problem?


Answer: (B) can correctly answer the math problem. Because (A) incorrectly calculated the area of the torn-off portion instead of the remaining portion.

Question: Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees. She also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. If she buys 2/5 times more of each item, what would be the total number of the items she will have if she currently has 60 marbles?

(A)
Answer:
Bella currently has 60 marbles.
She has two times as many marbles as frisbees, so she has 60 / 2 = 30 frisbees.
She has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, so she has 30 - 20 = 10 deck cards.
Now, she buys 2/5 times more of each item:
For marbles: 60 * (2/5) = 24 more marbles.
For frisbees: 30 * (2/5) = 12 more frisbees.
For deck cards: 10 * (2/5) = 4 more deck cards.
After buying more items, she will have:
Marbles: 60 + 24 = 84 marbles.
Frisbees: 30 + 12 = 42 frisbees.
Deck cards: 10 + 4 = 14 deck cards.
So, the total number of items she will have is 84 + 42 + 14 = 140.
So the answer is 140.

(B)
def solution():
    marbles_initial = 60
    frisbees_initial = marbles_initial * 2
    deck_cards_initial = frisbees_initial + 20
    marbles_bought = marbles_initial * 2 // 5
    frisbees_bought = frisbees_initial * 2 // 5
    deck_cards_bought = deck_cards_initial * 2 // 5
    marbles_total = marbles_initial + marbles_bought
    frisbees_total = frisbees_initial + frisbees_bought
    deck_cards_total = deck_cards_initial + deck_cards_bought
    total_items = marbles_total + frisbees_total + deck_cards_total
    result = total_items
    return result

Which of the above two choices can correctly answer the math problem? 

Answer: (A) can correctly answer the math problem. Because (B) incorrectly calculated the initial number of frisbees and deck_cards.

Question:: Pump A can fill a tank of water in 5 hours. Pump B can fill the same tank in 15 hours. How many minutes does it take the two pumps working together to fill the tank?

(A)
Answer:
Pump A can fill the tank in 5 hours.
So, Pump A can fill 1/5 of the tank in 1 hour.
Pump B can fill the tank in 15 hours.
So, Pump B can fill 1/15 of the tank in 1 hour.
When both pumps work together, they can fill (1/5 + 1/15) of the tank in 1 hour.
So they can fill (3/15 + 1/15) = 4/15 of the tank in 1 hour.
To convert 4/15 hours to minutes, we multiply by 60:
4/15 * 60 = 16 minutes.
So, the two pumps working together can fill the tank in 16 minutes.
So the answer is 16.

(B)
def solution():
    pump_a_rate = 1 / 5
    pump_b_rate = 1 / 15
    combined_rate = pump_a_rate + pump_b_rate
    time_to_fill = 1 / combined_rate
    time_to_fill_minutes = time_to_fill * 60  # Convert hours to minutes
    result = time_to_fill_minutes
    return result

Which of the above two choices can correctly answer the math problem?

Answer: (B) can correctly answer the math problem. Because (A) incorrectly calculated the time to fill the tank.

Question: You can buy 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price. You bought 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples and watermelons, and the price of 1 orange is $0.50. How much does 1 apple cost if your total bill was $66?

(A)
Answer:
You bought 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples, and watermelons.
So you bought 36 / 3 = 12 of each fruit.
You bought 12 oranges and each orange costs $0.50.
So the cost of the oranges is 12 * $0.50 = $6.
Your total bill was $66, and the cost of the oranges was $6.
So the cost of the apples and watermelons combined is $66 - $6 = $60.
Assuming the price of watermelon is W, the price of one apple is A.
Knowing that you can buy 4 apples for the same price and that the price of one apple is A, then 1W=4A.
So we have the equation:
12A + 12W = $60 (total cost of apples and watermelons)
12A + 12(4A) = $60
60 A = $60
Then we know the price of one apple is A = $1
So the answer is 1.

(B)
def solution():
    total_fruits = 36
    total_bill = 66
    orange_price = 0.50
    fruits_per_type = total_fruits // 3
    oranges_cost = fruits_per_type * orange_price
    apples_watermelons_cost = total_bill - oranges_cost

    apple_price_ratio = 4
    watermelon_price_ratio = 1
    total_ratio = apple_price_ratio + watermelon_price_ratio

    apple_cost =  apple_price_ratio * (apples_watermelons_cost / total_ratio)
    apple_price = apple_cost / fruits_per_type

    result = apple_price
    return result

Which of the above two choices can correctly answer the math problem?

Answer: (A) can correctly answer the math problem. Because (B) incorrectly calculates the apple_cost since 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price means 1 watermelon is 4 times the price of 1 apple.
