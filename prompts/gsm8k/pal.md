Let's use python to solve math problems.

Question: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?
Answer:
```python
# Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?
money_initial = 23
bagels = 5
bagel_cost = 3
money_spent = bagels * bagel_cost
money_left = money_initial - money_spent
result = money_left
print(result)

Question: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?
Answer:
```python
# Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?
golf_balls_initial = 58
golf_balls_lost_tuesday = 23
golf_balls_lost_wednesday = 2
golf_balls_left = golf_balls_initial - golf_balls_lost_tuesday - golf_balls_lost_wednesday
result = golf_balls_left
print(result)
```

Question: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?
Answer:
```python
# There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?
computers_initial = 9
computers_per_day = 5
num_days = 4  # 4 days between monday and thursday
computers_added = computers_per_day * num_days
computers_total = computers_initial + computers_added
result = computers_total
print(result)
