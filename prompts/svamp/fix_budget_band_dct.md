You need to follow the following process to solve the math problem：
1. Solution1, i.e., think step by step using natural language
2. Solution2, i.e., think step by step using natural language again
3. Then you need to scrutinize the sovling step of each solution and compare them with each other. Give a new correct solution. You need to pay attention to a few points:
    1. please note that you need to ensure that the final answer is the correct answer to the user's problem
    2. The answers to the two solutions may not be the same, and you need to double-check to get the right answer.
    3. Give your answer by `\boxed{}`.

Question: Dave had 21 apps on his phone. He added 89 new apps. After deleting some he had 24 left. How many more apps did he add than he deleted?

Answer: 
Solution1:
21 + 89 = 110 apps. After deleting some, Dave had 24 apps. The number of apps deleted is 110 - 24 = 86. The number of apps added is 89. The difference between the number of apps added and the number of apps deleted is 89 - 86 = 3. The answer is $\\boxed{3}$.

Solution2:
21 + 89 = 110. 110 - 24 = 86. The answer is $\\boxed{86}$.

Let's carefully analyze the two solutions for the given problem.

### Problem Statement:
Dave had 21 apps on his phone. He added 89 new apps. After deleting some, he had 24 left.  

### Analysis of Solutions:
1. Solution1:
   - Step 1: Calculates total apps after adding new ones:  
     21 + 89 = 110  apps.
   - Step 2: Determines how many were deleted to reach 24 apps:  
      110 - 24 = 86  apps deleted.
   - Step 3: Computes the difference between apps added and deleted:  
      89  (added)  - 86  (deleted)  = 3 .
   - Conclusion: The answer is 3.

2. Solution2:
   - Step 1: Calculates total apps after adding new ones:  
      21 + 89 = 110 .
   - Step 2: Determines how many were deleted to reach 24 apps:  
      110 - 24 = 86 .
   - Conclusion: Incorrectly concludes that the answer is 86 (which is the number of apps deleted, not the difference between added and deleted).

### Correct Solution:
1. Initial apps: 21  
2. Apps added: +89 → Total before deletions:  21 + 89 = 110   
3. Final apps after deletions: 24 → Apps deleted:  110 - 24 = 86   
4. Difference between added and deleted:  89  (added)  - 86  (deleted)  = 3 .  

Final Answer
Dave added $\boxed{3}$ more apps than he deleted.

Question: The cave is 1218 feet deep and they are already at 849 feet. If they are travelling at speed of 17 How much farther until they reach the end of the cave?

Answer: 
Solution1: 
1218 feet is the depth of the cave. They are already at 849 feet. The distance remaining to travel is 1218 - 849 = 369 feet. They are travelling at a speed of 17 feet per hour. The time it will take to travel 369 feet is 369 / 17 = 21.705882352941176 hours. The question asks how much farther until they reach the end of the cave. The answer is 369 feet. The answer is $\\boxed{369}$.

Solution2:
1218 - 849 = 369 feet remaining. The distance to the end of the cave is 369 feet. They travel at a speed of 17 feet per minute. So the time taken to reach the end of the cave is 369 / 17 = 21.705882352941176 minutes.\nThe question asks how much farther they have to travel. The distance remaining is 369 feet. The answer is $\\boxed{369}$.

Let's carefully analyze the two solutions for the given problem.

### Problem Statement:
The cave is 1218 feet deep, and they are already at 849 feet. They are traveling at a speed of 17 feet per [unit time].  

### Analysis of Solutions:
1. Solution1:
   - Step 1: Calculates the remaining distance:  
      1218 - 849 = 369  feet.
   - Step 2: Computes the time to travel 369 feet at 17 feet/hour:  
      369 / 17 \approx 21.7059  hours.
   - Conclusion: Correctly identifies the remaining distance as 369 feet (though the time calculation is unnecessary for the question asked).

2. Solution2:
   - Step 1: Calculates the remaining distance:  
      1218 - 849 = 369  feet.
   - Step 2: Computes the time to travel 369 feet at 17 feet/minute:  
      369 / 17 \approx 21.7059  minutes.
   - Conclusion: Correctly identifies the remaining distance as 369 feet (again, the time calculation is irrelevant to the question).

### Correct Solution:
1. Total depth of the cave: 1218 feet  
2. Current depth reached: 849 feet  
3. Remaining distance to the end:  1218 - 849 = 369  feet  

Final Answer
They have $\boxed{369}$ feet farther to travel to reach the end of the cave.
